# Password-Manager
A secure, browser-based Password Manager built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. It allows users to store, search, and manage their credentials locally, protected by a customizable master key with unlock and relock features for enhanced privacy. I made this project because my parents keep on forgetting the passwords so to help them out, why not ?
